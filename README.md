# voice-cloning-model

I have used a pretrained model so data collection, features extraction steps were not performed by me but some one else as I don't have the resources to trian the model either offline or online.

Training the Retrieval based Voice conversion model uses the following steps as mentioned by the owner of the model:

But since I used the pretrained model, I did not have to apply these steps.
 
After the model is trained is trained we feed in our .wav input file and the model outputs a .wav file which will be the audio of the person on which the model has been trained, i.e. in this case kanye west and elon musk.
